# VDB Manager Configuration Example
#
# Copy this file to ~/.vdb-manager/config.yaml or ~/.vdb-manager/config.yml
# and customize as needed. Both extensions are supported, with config.yaml
# taking precedence if both exist.
# The ~/.vdb-manager/ directory will be created automatically on first run.
# You can also override any setting using environment variables.
